# Cards

## Deck
Players start with a traditional deck of 52 cards with cards of 13 ranks and 4 suits, clubs, diamonds, hearts and spades + 2 regular jokers. As they win rounds, they can enhance their deck through the shop by purchasing common and modifier cards. This allows players to choose the type of deck they want to build according to their strategy.

## Types of Cards:

* Traditional cards: used to form classic poker plays (pair, flush, straight, etc.)
* Modifier cards: which can be applied to traditional cards to achieve various effects. There are three types: 
    * Add more points 
    * Add more multi 
    * Change suits
* Special cards: which apply global effects that can affect specific cards or the game itself. Each game has space for adding 5 special cards. There are two types:
    * Permanent: the only way to remove a special is through the discard
    * Temporary: self-destruct after 3 number of level
* Jokers: they always score, regardless of the played hand.
