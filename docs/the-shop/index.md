# The Shop

At the end of each round, the user can use the money earned in that round to level up the plays and/or add cards. 

The items that appear in the store are completely random. For play upgrades and common cards, all have the same chance of appearing in the store. However, for special and modifier cards, each one's likelihood of appearing in the store depends on its power.

The following items are listed in the store:

* 3 play upgrades
* 3 special cards, which activate immediately upon purchase.
* 4 modifier cards, which go into the deck.
* 5 traditional cards + jokers, which also go into the deck."

## Reroll

We will have the option to regenerate new items in the store through a reroll, which has a cost. The reroll can only be executed once each time I am in the store.
