# How Scoring Works

Each play has points, multi and a level. Total points are calculated by multiplying points by multi. When the level of a particular play is increased (from the store), its points and multipliers increase.

All traditional cards played in the hand are added to the points, according to their value (2 adds 2 points; 5 adds 5 points; ace adds 11 points; jack, queen, and king add 10 points; and the jokers add 100 points).

The multiplier is only altered by modifiers and special cards, as appropriate.

For instance,

Two pair hand of level 1 (points: 50, multiplier: 2)

* Two of hearts (+2 points)
* Modifier (+1 multiplier)
* Two of diamonds (+2 points)
* Ace of spades (+11 points)
* Ace of diamonds (+11 points)
* Special card +1 multiplier for each diamond card (+2 multiplier)

Total = (50 + 2 + 2 + 11 + 11) points x (2 + 1 + 2) multiplier = 76 points x 5 multiplier = 380 points
