# Game Mechanics

Players must reach a point target that increases with each round won. To achieve this point goal, we must make plays, in this case, poker plays.

Each game starts with five hands of cards and five discards per round. 

The player must select cards from their hand to play poker hands and score. A given number of discards are available to assist with creating better hands. 

If a player fails to meet the point target and runs out of hands to play, the game ends . Their score is recorded on a leaderboard.

If the player has a modifier card in their hand, they can discard it to draw a new card. This discard is not counted as part of the discards. 

Also, the player can discard a special card to have it replaced by another special card that they can purchase in the store.

Upon reaching the required points, they access a store where they can use their points to enhance their plays and acquire special cards that provide unique abilities or modify the game conditions.
