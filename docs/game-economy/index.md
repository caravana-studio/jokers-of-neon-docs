# Game Economy

Participation in the PRO competition requires an entry ticket, with its value distributed as follows:

* 70% to the current PRO competition pool
* 7% to the current FREE competition pool
* 10% to the next cycle's PRO competition pool
* 1% to the next cycle's FREE competition pool
* The remainder is used to cover fees and profit.

Thus, the more players participate, the larger the prize pool.

(The percentages are indicative; a more in-depth study will be conducted later.)

Contract owners can add funds to the competition pool but never withdraw, ensuring transparency and fairness.
